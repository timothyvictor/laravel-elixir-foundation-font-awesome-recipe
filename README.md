# laravel-elixir-foundation-recipe
An Elixir recipe for Foundation Framework. Be sure you've followed the instructions in the Laravel documentation to get started with Elixir.

## How to use

First, you'll need to install Foundation, using Bower, to the `resources/assets` folder. After you've done that...

* Download or clone this repository and copy the contents of gulpfile.js into your Laravel project's gulpfile.js
* Run `gulp` from the terminal
* Add the `app.scss` file from this repository into the `resources/assets/sass` folder in Laravel
* Add the `app.js` file from this repository into the `resources/assets/js` folder in Laravel
* Run `gulp` one more time

That should do it!
